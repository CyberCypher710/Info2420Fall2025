<h2> Questions:</h2>

<ol>
	<li> What was your first impression of this site?</li>
	<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li>
	<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>
	<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from
it? Why?</li>
	<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time
reasonable?</li>

navigation well done?</li>
	<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all
the pages?</li>

<h2>Website 1 Critique: Jami Lin</h2>
<h4><a href="https://www.jamilin.com/#">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>

	<li>My first impression of this website was that it’s very colorful, but almost to the point of being overwhelming. There’s so much going on that it’s hard to focus on one thing, and I wasn’t sure where to even start. On top of that, the overall vibe of the site felt a little like a scam, almost like it's main purpose was to get money out of people. I can’t pinpoint exactly why I felt that way, but the design gives off a scam-like impression.</li>
	<li>This site seems to have links eveywhere you click and there doesnt seem to be much flow to it. It seems as if it's click around and explore until you find where you want to go.</li>
	<li>The site structure is super confusing like for example the first link you click Jami Lin's Tranformations it just pulls up a new tab of the page you are already on (which the home page isn't titled that). Also the pop up to get a free galactic gem portal is annoying and makes it feel even more like a scam.</li>
	<li>I would say the sites graphics detract from the site because there are so many graphics that you feel overwhelmed.</li>
	<li> The Homepage opened up immediately.</li>
	<li> I'd say that the text and everything was easy to read but with so much visually going on with graphics you kind of dont want to read anything the page has to offer.</li>
	<li> The website does have a navigation bar kind of in-between the top and center of the page which looks decent. But again I'm afraid to click on anything because it all feels like a scam or im going to get a virus from exploring this page further.</li>
	<li>So I did click through the pages, and so far no virus just still selling scams. On the other pages I did see that there is color and stuff added to the other pages. But if the color scheme is word and graphic vomit they definetly nailed it!!! There is just so many things that grab your eye all at once. What it really seems like is that they didnt have enough room to cram all that information into one place, and now it's become overcrowded.</li>
	<li>The site actually responds surprisingly well to smaller window sizes. I made it as small as I could and it went completly verticle like it would if you were looking at it on a phone. So big points there! </li>
	<li>I'd say that the site offers an unusual eyesore. It seems like a very well done example of what not to do.</li>
